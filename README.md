# This application is a simple C++ program that lists all running processes on your Windows system using more than 200 megabytes (MB) of RAM. For each of these processes, it displays:

# Process ID (PID):
A unique number assigned to each running process.
# Memory Usage: 
The amount of RAM the process is currently using, measured in kilobytes (KB).
# Process Name: 
The name of the executable file associated with the process.
# Window Class Name:
The class name of the window associated with the process, if it has one; otherwise, it indicates "<no window>".
This information helps you identify which applications are consuming significant memory resources on your computer.
